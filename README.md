# ABI Ninja

Interact with any contract on Ethereum. ABI Ninja provides an intuitive frontend for contracts from most popular EVM networks, currently supporting:

- **Verified contracts**. Pulls the code from [AnyABI](https://anyabi.xyz/) and [Etherscan API](https://docs.etherscan.io/) as a fallback option.
- **Unverified contracts**. Two different options are available:
  - Decompile using [`heimdall-rs`](https://github.com/Jon-Becker/heimdall-rs) (experimental).
  - Provide the ABI and the contract address.
- **Proxy contracts**. Autodetects most popular proxy patterns, and allows to read and write as proxy.

ABI Ninja (v2) is built with üèó [Scaffold-ETH 2](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2).

# üß™ Testing

ABI Ninja uses Cypress for end-to-end testing. Our test suite covers user flows and ensures the application works correctly across different networks and contract types. The test suite will automatically run on pull requests.

## Running Tests

To run the Cypress tests:

1. Ensure your development server is running:

```
yarn start
```

2. In a new terminal window, run the Cypress tests:

```
yarn cypress:open
```

This will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can run individual tests or the entire suite.

3. For headless testing, use:

```
yarn cypress:run
```

## Test Coverage

Our tests cover the following key areas:

- Loading and interacting with verified contracts on various networks
- Handling unverified contracts and manual ABI input
- Detecting and interacting with proxy contracts
- Network switching and custom network addition

## Writing New Tests

When adding new features or modifying existing ones, please update or add corresponding tests. Test files are located in the `cypress/e2e` directory.

For more information on writing Cypress tests, refer to the Cypress Documentation.
